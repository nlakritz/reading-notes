# The Elements of Style
by William Strunk Jr.

"The best writers sometimes ignore the rules of rhetoric. When they do so, however, the reader will find some compensation merit, attained at the cost of the violation."

## Rules of Usage

### 1.) Form possessive singular by adding 's.
- Charles's friend
- Burn's poems
- the witch's malice

### 2.) Oxford comma!

### 3.) Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas.
- Clauses that don't identify the antecedent noun are considered parenthetic
    - The audience, which had been indifferent, became more and more interested.
    - The candidate who best meets these requirements will win.
- Phrases that interrupt flow are considered parenthetic
    - The best way to travel, unless you are pressed for time, is on foot.

### 4.) Comma before conjunction introducing a coordinate clause.
- The situation is perilous, but there is still chance of escape.
- If the subject is the same for both clauses and expressed only once, you don't need a comma when the conjunction is "and"
    - He has experience and is skillful.
    - It's cold outside, and I can't find my jacket.

### 5.) Joining independent clauses requires a semicolon. This suggests a close relationship of cause or consequence between the clauses.

### 6.) Don't use periods for commas.

### 7.) A participal phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject.
- Young and inexperienced, the task seemed easy to me. (incorrect; subject is "the task")
- Young and inexperienced, I thought the task easy. (correct; subject is "I")
- Walking down the road, he saw a woman with two children. (the phrase refers to "he", the subject, not the woman)

## Rules of Composition

### 8.) Divide a subject into smaller topics with one paragraph per topic. In dialogue, each speech by change of speaker is a new paragraph.

### 9.) Each paragraph should begin with a topic sentence and conclude with something that relates to it.

### 10.) Use active voice.
- I will always remember my first visit to Boston. (active)
- My first visit to Boston will always be remebered by me. (passive)
- Passive voice is sometimes necessary.
    - Dramatists are little esteemed by modern readers. (passive; good if paragraph focuses on dramatists, even though it's in passive voice)
    - Modern readers have little esteem for dramatists. (active; good if paragraph focuses on modern readers)
- One passive shouldn't depend on another
    - Gold was not **allowed** to be **exported**. (incorrect)
    - The export of gold was not allowed. (correct)
- Active voice can be made more interesting by adding descriptions

### 11.) Put statements in positive form. The reader doesn't want to be told what is not, they want to know what is.
- He did not think studying Latin was useful. (negative)
- He thought studying Latin was useless. (positive)

### 12.) Be specific, definite, and concrete.

### 13.) Omit unnecessary words. Common useless phrases include "the fact that", "who is", and "which was".
- Active voice and positive form are naturally concise, adhering to this rule.

### 14.) Avoid series of loose sentences, which use and, but, so, who, which, when, where, and while.
- Good example of a loose sentence is the one above.

### 15.) Similar ideas with similar function should be expressed in similar form.
- The French, the Spanish, and the Italian.
- In spring, summer, or winter.
- Formerly, science was taught by the textbook method; now it is taught by the laboratory method.

### 16.) Keep related words together.
- Relative pronouns should immediately follow their antecedents
    - There was a **look** in his eye **that** boded mischief. (incorrect)
    - In his eye was a **look** **that** boded mischief. (correct)
- Subject and verb should not be separated
    - Cast **iron**, when treated, **is** changed into steel. (incorrect)
    - When treated, cast **iron** **is** changed into steel. (correct)

### 17.) In summaries, use present tense.

### 18.) Place emphatic phrases of a sentence at the end.
- This is an exception to Rule 16, as you might want to move something that's not emphatic between the subject and verb, so that the sentence ends with emphasis on the verb phrase
- Emphatic words usually introduce something new

## Form
- An entire sentence in parentheses should have punctuation at the end, within the parentheses
- Quotations
    - Formal quotations are introduced by a colon
        - The provision of the Constitution is: "..."
    - Quotations introduced by "that" should be paraphrased and do not require quotes
        - He declares that memes are epic.
- References
    - Don't explain where a reference is coming from if it's being used multiple times
        - In the second scene of the third act, she dies. (incorrect)
        - She dies (III.ii 15). (correct)
- Titles
    - Omit "A" or "The" in titles if there is a possessive before them
        - Dicken's *Tale of Two Cities*

## Commonly Misued Words and Expressions

- Mine is as good or better than his. -> Mine is as good as his, or better.
- Extension of Rule 14 — a loose sentence with "but" can be turned into a periodic sentence with "although"

    - Although small, he is strong (better)
- Extension of Rule 14 — a loose sentence with "so" can be turned into a periodic sentence with "as"
- claimed that -> claimed to be
- "compare to" is for similarities between things considered different; "compare with" is for differences between things considered the same
- different than -> different from / unlike
- due to -> through / because of
- folks -> folk
- "However" shouldn't start a sentence when it means "nevertheless", move it to the middle instead
- "less" is for amount, "fewer" is for number
- possessed -> had
- Don't put something between an infinitive
    - To dilligently inquire (incorrect)
    - To inquire dilligently (correct)
